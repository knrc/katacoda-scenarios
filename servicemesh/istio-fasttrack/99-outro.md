Istio provides an easy way to create a network of deployed services with load balancing, service-to-service authentication, monitoring, and more, without requiring any changes in service code. You add Istio support to services by deploying a special sidecar proxy throughout your environment that intercepts all network communication between microservices, configured and managed using Istioâ€™s control plane functionality.

Technologies like containers and container orchestration platforms like OpenShift solve the deployment of our distributed
applications quite well, but are still catching up to addressing the service communication necessary to fully take advantage
of distributed microservice applications. With Istio you can solve many of these issues outside of your business logic,
freeing you as a developer from concerns that belong in the infrastructure. Congratulations!
